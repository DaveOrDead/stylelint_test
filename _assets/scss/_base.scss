/**
 * Here we provide very basic styling that most UI's will need. These styles
 * are applied at the most global level being applied via element selectors.
 * Everything in Base needs to be easily overridden which is really easy to do
 * as everything in Base sits right at the bottom in terms of specificity.
 *
 * Some of this styling builds on top of Shell's "Base".
